        So, why does the english version appear to have a better structure? I presume it has something to do with the way word recognition works in the visual/auditory pathways of the brain [1]. In the english paragraph which is obviously meaningless, our brain recognizes overall shapes of words and the relationship between them. At some later time in the pipeline, the limbic system tries to make sense of the sentence, we have an uncaught exception (in computer programming lingo): the visual system was happy with it, from V1-V5 regions of the brain do not catch symantic exceptions, that happens, I am guessing, in the fusiform-gyrus based on some of the things Dr. V.S. Ramachandran, a neuroscientist at the UC San Deigo, has presented in his talk repetoire.

        The fundamental concepts of classical physics, space, time, mass, and derived concepts, velocity, momentum, force, angular momentum, energy ... all rest on the principle that material points have trajectories. They are defined as lines in space-time. Even the dynamics of continuous, solid or fluid media describes the trajectories of the material points which constitute the bodies in motion. But the indeterminacy relation of Heisenberg prevents quantum particles from having such classical trajectories, since their position and velocity can not be exactly defined at the same time. How then can it explain all the appearances which legitimize the fundamental concepts of classical physics?
